However, some major modes may require additional setup for code completion to
work in them. Some major modes may have no completion support at all. Check that
major mode's module's documentation for details.

* Features
** Code completion
By default, completion is triggered after a short idle period. While the popup
is visible, the following keys are available:

| Keybind | Description                              |
|---------+------------------------------------------|
| =C-n=   | Go to next candidate                     |
| =C-p=   | Go to previous candidate                 |
| =C-j=   | (evil) Go to next candidate              |
| =C-k=   | (evil) Go to previous candidate          |
| =C-h=   | Display documentation (if available)     |
| =C-u=   | Move to previous page of candidates      |
| =C-d=   | Move to next page of candidates          |
| =S-TAB= | Select previous candidate                |

** Vim-esque omni-completion prefix (C-x)
In the spirit of Vim's omni-completion, the following insert mode keybinds are
available to evil users:

| Keybind   | Description                       |
|-----------+-----------------------------------|
| =C-x C-]= | Complete tags                     |
| =C-x C-f= | Complete file path                |
| =C-x C-k= | Complete from dictionary/keyword  |
| =C-x C-l= | Complete full line                |
